# Learning HTML Basics 

## what is HTML? 

- HTML structures all webpages on the internet
- HTML code tells web browsers how to display elements on the webpage, such as text, images, and links
- an element in HTML consists of an opening tag <>, a closing tag </>, and the code in between

## tags in HTML

`<html> </html>`
- this will create an HTML webpage

`<body> </body>` 
- this will define the body of a webpage

**those two elements form the structure of a webpage!**

---

`<button> hello world </button>`
- this will create a button called "hello world" on the webpage

`<p> hello world </p>`
- this will create a paragraph that contains the words "hello world" on the webpage

`<h1> hello world </h1>`
- this will create a heading called "hello world" on the webpage
- there are many different headings depending on the number; in h1-h6, the size of the heading decreases as the number increases

`<head> </head>`
- this is the title of a webpage. it appears in the tab or window of the web browser

`<head> <title> hello world </title> </head>`
- this will give the webpage the title, "hello world"

`<!doctype html>` 
- this will tell the web browser what version of HTML we are using. we will use this since we are using the latest version
- usually goes at the top
- if this tag is not present, the web browser will have to guess which HTML version is being used

**text enhancers**

`<br>`
- this will cause a line break when placed next to a piece of code. for example, inside a paragraph tag

`<em> </em>`
- when a string is placed between these tags, the word will be italicized

`<strong> </strong>`
- when a string is placed between these tags, the word will be bolded
